# Scripting with wscript

Wolvenkit is scriptable using javascript and its internal API. With it you can automate tasks such as exporting, as well as make changes to files programmatically.

Scripts are accessed via the **Script Manager** in the **Tools** menu.&#x20;

To add a script simply type a filename such as MyScript.wscript and hit add. The file will now be in the list and you can double click to edit it in the Wolvenkit interface.&#x20;

The editor shows your source code with code formatting and includes code suggestion for the Wolvenkit api.&#x20;

For questions or suggestions about the scripting interface please visit the #wolvenkit-scripts channel on the [Discord server](../../help/community.md).

## API Commands

Documentation of the API can be found at [https://wolvenkit.github.io/WolvenKit/index.html](https://wolvenkit.github.io/WolvenKit/index.html)

This documentation is generated by Doxygen from the codebase so will update as the API evolves.



## Utility Functions
