# Video and audio files (CLI)

{% hint style="info" %}
This page is about the command line interface. For the Wolvenkit GUI, check [video-and-audio.md](../../wolvenkit-app/usage/video-and-audio.md "mention")
{% endhint %}

## Archives

Required files are contained within these archives

* audio\_1\_general.archive
* audio\_2\_soundbanks.archive
* basegame\_5\_video.archive
* lang\_en\_voice.archive

## Video files

Using [the tool](https://github.com/WolvenKit/WolvenKit-nightly-releases/releases/latest), decompress **basegame\_5\_video.archive** located at: `<gamedir>\Cyberpunk 2077\archive\pc\content`.

```
WolvenKit.Cli.exe unbundle -p "<gamedir>\Cyberpunk 2077\archive\pc\content\<nameofarchive>" -o "<outputfolder>"
```

Once extracted, they can be viewed via [RADTools](http://www.radgametools.com/bnkdown.htm) as Bink Videos and converted to other formats.

## Audio files

[ww2ogg](https://github.com/hcs64/ww2ogg) can be used to convert decompressed archive audio to .ogg through command line, as well as [Revorb](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/QmVgjfU7qgPEtANatrfh7VQJby9t1ojrTbN7X8Ei4djF4e/revorb.exe) (both of these tools have Linux versions that can be found [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/6265)) to get smaller and cleaner files that can be played via other media players such as VLC. [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) can be used for more convenient playback.

To execute conversion:\
`.\ww2ogg.exe "<!AudioFilePath!>.wem" --pcb packed_codebooks_aoTuV_603.bin`

{% hint style="warning" %}
Make sure to include the `--pcb` argument â€“ you will only get gibberish if you don't.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
The files are optimized for people with audio dampener. If you don't pack any, turn down your volume. You have been warned!
{% endhint %}

A combination of these tools can be found at the [Wwise Audio Tools repository](https://github.com/WolvenKit/wwise-audio-tools) which has a command line tool that can be downloaded from the repository or installed through the AUR. It has Linux and Windows support and converts WEM files to OGG without the hassle of the external PCB file or having to run through multiple programs for a clean output.

`./wwtools` converts all WEMs in the current directory to OGG files\
`./wwtools wem [input.wem] (--info)` will convert the specified WEM to OGG and if the optional info flag is used it will print the information about the file and exit.

Playback through ffmpeg:\
`ffplay.exe <!AudioFilePath!>.ogg`\
\
[Foobar2000](http://www.foobar2000.org) can also be used along with its [vgmstream](https://www.foobar2000.org/components/view/foo\_input\_vgmstream) plugin.
