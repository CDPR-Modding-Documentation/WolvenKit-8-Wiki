{% endhint %}

You can find the toolbar below the [.](./ "mention").

## Toolbar options

### New File

Same as the menu entry [#file](./#file "mention")-> [#new-file](./#new-file "mention") (creates a new game file)

### Save

Same as the menu entry [#file](./#file "mention")-> [#save](./#save "mention") (saves the currently active editor)

### Save As

Same as the menu entry [#file](./#file "mention")-> [#save-as](./#save-as "mention")(saves a copy of the currently active file)

### Save All

Same as the menu entry [#file](./#file "mention")-> [#save-all](./#save-all "mention") (saves all currently open file)

### Create Zip

Same as the menu entry [#build](./#build "mention") -> [#pack-project](./#pack-project "mention")

### Install Mod

Same as the menu entry [#build](./#build "mention") -> [#install](./#install "mention")

## Install

Same as the menu entry [#build](./#build "mention") -> [#install](./#install "mention")

### Install and launch

Like Install, but launches the game afterwards.&#x20;

### Hot Reload

Same as the menu entry [#build](./#build "mention") -> [#hot-reload](./#hot-reload "mention"). Requires [RedHotTools](https://app.gitbook.com/s/4gzcGtLrr90pVjAWVdTc/for-mod-creators-theory/modding-tools/redhottools "mention").

## Additional toolbar options

You can activate the REDMod entries in the [settings](../settings.md) under "Interface".

### Pack as REDMod

Same as the menu entry [#build](./#build "mention") -> [#pack-as-redmod](./#pack-as-redmod "mention")

{% hint style="info" %}
As a rule of thumb, you **generally don't want this**. Vortex can auto-convert to REDMod on install. Packing your mod in the legacy format will save work for those people who don't want to use REDMod.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Install as REDMod

Same as the menu entry [#build](./#build "mention") -> [#install-as-redmod](./#install-as-redmod "mention")
