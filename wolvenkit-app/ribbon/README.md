## What is the Ribbon?

![UPDATE WolvenKit Ribbon](../../.gitbook/assets/8.2\_ribbon\_pe\_actions.png)

The WolvenKit Editor contains a ribbon-style navigation menu. The Ribbon contains options for managing files, context sensitive buttons, and access to all of WolvenKit's editors and tools. Nearly all aspects of WovenKit can be viewed or managed by navigating the Ribbon.
