# Contributing

## Interested in contributing code?

Please do! Fork the project and please commit your changes in small incremental steps with descriptive messages. Code quality is not the biggest concern but refrain from simple mistakes. It's a good idea to create an issue when implementing a feature so people don't work on the same feature/issue in an asynchronous manner.

* Join the [Cyberpunk 2077 Modding Server](https://github.com/WolvenKit/WolvenKit/blob/463-Import-Export-Tool/discord.gg/Epkq79kd96) for active development
* Visit our [GitHub organization](https://github.com/WolvenKit) to track progress, development, and issues

## I'm not a programmer, how can I help?

The best way to contribute to WolvenKit directly without submitting code is by writing documentation or guides. We are always in need of help documenting WolvenKit within this wiki. You can submit changes by creating a GitBook account and using this invitation to our Organization: [https://app.gitbook.com/invite/-MP5ijqI11FeeX7c8-N8/OVHjxIctfql4c2fCdDv9](https://app.gitbook.com/invite/-MP5ijqI11FeeX7c8-N8/OVHjxIctfql4c2fCdDv9)\
