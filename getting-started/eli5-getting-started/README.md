This guide is intended for the beginning modder, who is still learning, and wants step-by-step instructions on how to fully install and configure their modding tools and asset depot.&#x20;

To keep things simple, the recommendations in this guide will centralize many of the modding applications, assets, and related resources.&#x20;

### Requirements

* [Download Wolvenkit](../download.md)

{% hint style="danger" %}
If any of the steps in this guide fail, then STOP immediately and either fix them or ask for help on [Discord](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-MP5ijqI11FeeX7c8-N8/s/-MP\_ozZVx2gRZUPXkd4r/\~/changes/319/wolvenkit-app/eli5-getting-started).&#x20;

Some of the recommendations in this guide may be outdated or obsolete by the time you read it. In that case, use your best judgement and play around!
{% endhint %}

### Prerequisites <a href="#_toc116953931" id="_toc116953931"></a>

1. Hard disk space for the Depot:&#x20;
   * For **regular operations**, <5GB storage will be enough
   * If you want to **extract materials and meshes**, you should have at least 15GB storage
   * Optional: If you want to **create a full asset depot**, then you want at least 75GB storage. \
     If you are reading this guide, then you won't need that.
2. Optional, but recommended: a basic level of computer knowledge. The guide contains detailed instructions, but you'll have an easier time if you already know things like like:
   * Open a command prompt and run a command,
   * Locate your download folder and extract a zipped file,
   * Install an application,
   * Find and move files

Remember, if you don't know how to do something, you can always throw the question into Google or ask ChatGPT or the Bing assistant!

## We goin' in?

First, install Wolvenkit:

{% content-ref url="../download.md" %}
[download.md](../download.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Then, we'll start with [general prep work](prep-your-computer.md):

{% content-ref url="prep-your-computer.md" %}
[prep-your-computer.md](prep-your-computer.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Let's configure and set up Wolvenkit and all its plugins:

{% content-ref url="configure-modding-tools.md" %}
[configure-modding-tools.md](configure-modding-tools.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Then, we unbundle those game assets that we needâ€¦

{% content-ref url="../../wolvenkit-app/usage/create-depot.md" %}
[create-depot.md](../../wolvenkit-app/usage/create-depot.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Now we're goin' in.&#x20;

We do that by creating a tiny mod to make sure everything worked OK.&#x20;

Feel free to skip this step, or hit up the [modding wiki](https://wiki.redmodding.org/cyberpunk-2077-modding/for-mod-creators/modding-guides) and get cracking.
