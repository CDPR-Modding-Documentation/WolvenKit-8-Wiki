# File Editor

## What is the File Editor?

The File Editor is a document viewer and manipulator for modifying any REDengine file. WolvenKit is the only RTTI-based editor for RED4.

## Using the File Editor

REDengine files can be viewed by double-clicking them within the [**Project Explorer**](project-explorer.md). The File Editor expects unbundled files with compressed internal buffers, so we recommend using files added to the project using the [**Asset Browser**](asset-browser.md) to ensure compatibility.\

After making changes to a RED4 file, use the **Save File** or **Save All** button within the General section of the Ribbon to save changes. The document can then be closed, and packed with the mod project.
