## General

### **Update Channel**

The update channel determines which type WolvenKit updates are received.

* **Stable**    WolvenKit will only show prompts when new releases are published (recommended)
* **Nightly**    WolvenKit will show the latest development builds which may be unstable

### WolvenKit Theme

Changes the accent color of UI elements throughout WolvenKit.

## Cyberpunk 2077

### **Game Executable (.exe) Location**

The **Game Executable (.exe) Location** can be set by manually entering a file path, or using the folder icon to browse system files for the preferred Cyberpunk installation. As a reminder, if Cyberpunk is installed within Program Files we recommend running WolvenKit as administrator.

### **Material Repository**

The **Material Repository** is a WolvenKit system folder for creating a cache of textures and other Cyberpunk assets. The Material Repository destination is set by default to `.../User/AppData/Roaming/REDModding/WolvenKit/MaterialDepot`, however any custom folder can be substituted. A full repository can be in excess of 30 gigabytes, so we recommend a destination with ample free disk space.
