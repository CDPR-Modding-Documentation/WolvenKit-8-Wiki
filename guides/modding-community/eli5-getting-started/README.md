# ELI5: Getting Started

## Summary

**Created by @JJTurtle**\
**Published October 22 2022**

This guide is intended for the beginning modder, who is still learning, and wants step-by-step instructions on how to fully install and configure their modding tools and asset depot. To reduce the learning curve, the recommendations in this guide will centralize many of the modding applications, assets, and related resources. For the Asset Depot, you will need to make a judgement call on how much hard drive space you’re okay claiming. Read the [Create Depot](create-depot.md#section-brief) Section Brief for more information.

### Requirements

* [**WolvenKit 8.7**](https://github.com/WolvenKit/WolvenKit)****

{% hint style="danger" %}
If any of the steps in this guide fail then STOP immediately and ask for help on Discord. It’s important to have a dependable start, else when you start modding you won’t know if the problem is the tool or your mod. Some recommendations in this guide do not match the mod author’s intent, such as the location of the asset depot. As of 10/12/2022 none of these recommendations broke or reduced the functionality of the modding tools.

### Prerequisites <a href="#_toc116953931" id="_toc116953931"></a>

   * Locate your download folder and extract a zipped file,
   * Install an application,

   * Google random questions like, “What is a GLB file?”
