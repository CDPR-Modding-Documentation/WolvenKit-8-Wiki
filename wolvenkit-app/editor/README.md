# Editor

## What is the Editor?

The Editor is the main mod-editing workspace within WolvenKit. Within the Editor is the [**Toolbar**](toolbar.md) and the docking window for modding tools such as the [**Asset Browser**](asset-browser.md) and [**Project Explorer**](project-explorer.md).

## Docking

The docking in WolvenKit is similar to other IDE's such as Visual Studio. WolvenKit editors can be rearranged by docking to specific areas, or used as a standalone floating window.

Try double-clicking an Editor title bar to create a floating window!&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Status Bar

The Status Bar along the bottom of the application window contains useful information such as your WolvenKit build number and the current mod project, and provide the ability to install new updates if available.
