# Asset Browser

## What is the Asset Browser?

The Asset Browser is used to navigate, search and filter Cyberpunk 2077 game files so you can transfer these to the [**Project Explorer.**](project-explorer.md) The Asset Browser eliminates the need for uncooking the entire game installation, as individual files can be pulled directly from archive files.

## Where is it?

In the default view (as of 8.11), you will find it pinned to the right side of the viewport.

If it isn't there, check the **View** menu and make sure that it's enabled.

## Using the Asset Browser

{% hint style="info" %}
Wolvenkit Search has its own sub-page: [wolvenkit-search-finding-files.md](../usage/wolvenkit-search-finding-files.md "mention")
{% endhint %}

### Navigation

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/8.5 Asset Browser.png>)

The left-side breadcrumb navigator can be used to quickly navigate through game directories. Game files are displayed in the right-side panel, in addition to folders. Folders in the file list can also be navigated by double-clicking.

### Mod Browser

You can switch the Asset Browser to Mod Browsing mode via button. The [search](asset-browser.md#search) will no longer consider base game files and search in your loaded .archives instead.

### Adding files to projects

* **Double-click files** _to add them directly to the_ **Project Explorer**
* **To select multiple files** hold shift and then left click two separate files. These two files and all files between them will be selected. Right-click any of the highlighted files to open the context menu. Then choose **Add Selected Item(s) to Project.**

{% hint style="info" %}
Files added to the Project Explorer with the Asset Browser will not include external buffer files. Buffers are stored within the main file.
