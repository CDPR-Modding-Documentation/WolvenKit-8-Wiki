# Contributing

> Please do! Fork the project and please commit your changes in small incremental steps with descriptive messages. Code quality is not the biggest concern but refrain from stupid mistakes that may lead to the denial of the pull request. It's a good idea to create an issue when implementing a feature so people don't work on the same feature/issue in an asynchronous manner.\
