## What's a Home good for?

## Welcome

When WolvenKit is launched the **Home** functions as bulletin board to help you pick up where you left off. Recent mod projects are displayed as a scrolling list of cards which can be directly clicked to get started. Other crucial functions for creating or opening projects are displayed in the right-hand column.

The WolvenKit icon can also be used to swap between Home and the Editor!
