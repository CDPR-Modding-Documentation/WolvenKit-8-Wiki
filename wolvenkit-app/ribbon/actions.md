# Actions

## What is the Actions tab?

The functionality of the Actions tab is **context-sensitive**, unlike other areas of the Ribbon. The content of the Action tab will vary based on which editor window is currently selected. For instance, while the [**Project Explorer**](../editor/project-explorer.md) is selected operations for deleting files become available within the Actions tab.
