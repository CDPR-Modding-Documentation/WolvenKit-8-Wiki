# Log

## What is the Log?

The Log is WolvenKit's internal logging service to inform the user of what's happening under the hood. It also shows output from the [file-validation.md](../file-validation.md "mention") feature, which will check file connections for you.

If something is not working as expected, take a peak into the Log to check for useful information.
