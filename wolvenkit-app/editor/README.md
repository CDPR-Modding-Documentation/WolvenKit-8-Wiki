# Editor

## What is the Editor?

The Editor is the main mod-editing workspace within WolvenKit. Within the Editor is the [**Ribbon**](../ribbon/) and the docking window for modding tools such as the [**Asset Browser**](asset-browser.md) and [**Project Explorer**](project-explorer.md).

## Docking

The docking in WolvenKit is similar to other IDE's such as Visual Studio. WolvenKit editors can be rearranged by docking to specific areas, or used as a standalone floating window.

## Status Bar

The Status Bar along the bottom of the application window contains useful information such as your WolvenKit build number and the current mod project.
