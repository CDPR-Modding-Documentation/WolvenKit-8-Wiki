### Easy

Recommended for beginners. Many properties that you won't want to edit are hidden, other properties that you shouldn't edit are write-protected.

### Default

Should show all properties that you realistically want to edit for regular use cases. Autogenerated properties are write-protected, irrelevant properties (e.g. `platform`) is hidden.

### Advanced

The authentic editing experience from <=  8.14. Rawdogging CR2W without protection. Use at own risk.
