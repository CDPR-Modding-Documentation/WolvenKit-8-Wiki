# Setup

## First Launch

When launching WolvenKit for the first time you will be greeted with a welcome form asking to set your preferences. We recommend setting the path to your game files immediately. If you should close this form, you can access the same [**Settings**](../wolvenkit-app/settings.md) at any time through the Home page.

The **Game Executable  Path** **(.exe)** can be set by manually entering a file path, or using the folder icon to browse system files for the preferred Cyberpunk installation. As a reminder, if Cyberpunk is installed within Program Files we recommend running WolvenKit as administrator.

The **Depot Path** is a WolvenKit system folder for creating a cache of textures and other Cyberpunk assets. The Depot Path is set by default to `.../AppData/Roaming/REDModding/WolvenKit/MaterialDepot`, however any custom folder can be substituted. A Depot with materials can be in excess of 30 gigabytes, so we recommend a destination with ample free disk space.

Be sure to set the Game Executable Path! Functionality is extremely diminished if WolvenKit cannot properly locate your game installation.

### Using WolvenKit

Creating a new mod project is necessary to begin using most WolvenKit features. A new project can be created from the [**Welcome**](broken-reference) page or the [**Toolbar**](../wolvenkit-app/editor/toolbar.md#new-project). If you're new to WolvenKit, we strongly recommend reading the next wiki section, [**Creating a Mod**](creating-a-mod.md).
