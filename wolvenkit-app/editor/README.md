# Editor

## What is the Editor?

The Editor is the main mod-editing workspace within WolvenKit, holding the docking window for the individual [#editor-panels](./#editor-panels "mention").

## Docking

The docking in WolvenKit is similar to other IDE's such as Visual Studio. All panels can be rearranged by docking to specific areas, or used as a standalone floating window.

Try double-clicking an Editor title bar to create a floating window!&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Status Bar

The Status Bar along the bottom of the application window contains useful information such as your **WolvenKit version number** and the current mod project, and provide the ability to install new updates if available.
