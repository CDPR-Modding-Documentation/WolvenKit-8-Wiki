## Material JSON I/O

WolvenKit supports importing and exporting REDengine material information in the form of a bespoke **material json** file. In lieu of a full-blown file editor to tweak materials directly, we support adjusting materials through the material json. When exporting meshes the application presents an option for `WithMaterials` which generates the material json. [**Read more about that process here**](./#withmaterials).\
\
The mechanism for generating material json files is baked deeply into the WolvenKit pipeline.&#x20;

* We rely on the [**Depot**](../../../settings.md#depot-path) (a local file cache) which contains all material dependencies for any given mesh.\

* For each `WithMaterials` mesh export, the material dependencies are analyzed and missing resources are dumped to the Depot.\

* The material json is generated by looking at the complete daisy chain of materials. Meaning every single dependency is reviewed and the top-most properties that REDengine sees are written to the material json file.\

* The REDengine values written into the material json file can be interpreted by the Blender Cyberpunk glTF importer to automatically set up shaders within Blender Cycles. [**Read more about Blender integration here**](../blender-integration.md#importing-cyberpunk-meshes-with-blender).
