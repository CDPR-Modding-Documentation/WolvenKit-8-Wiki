## What's a Home good for?

### Home

When WolvenKit is launched the **Home** functions as bulletin board to help you pick up where you left off. Recent mod projects are displayed as a scrolling list of cards which can be directly clicked to get started. Other crucial functions for creating or opening projects are displayed front and center making WolvenKit intuitive and efficient.

{% hint style="info" %}
Both the Sammy (the WolvenKit icon) and the exit icon on the bottom left can be used to navigate to the Editor! (and vice versa)
{% endhint %}
